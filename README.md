# PyLadies Berlin Setup Events
Introduction of topics to get ready for programming in Python, followd by a learning experience in small groups.

Getting over the first hurdles can be a tricky part. Our annual PyLadies Setup Events bring people together to learn about programming in Python, how to get started with Python IDE's, virtual environments or basic functionalities. You are beginning your Python journey (again) just now? Let's do this together!

## Typical structure 
This is a regular Meetup in a smaller learning group to give learners ( especially Python newcommers ) a save and comfortable space. Everyone is welcome to join in, if a refresh is needed or if you are just starting to dip your toes into the wild and magnificent ocean of Python programming.

Since there is a time contraint of a couple of hours, many things would need to be left out, but the objective should be to solve an issue the attendees are facing during a first contact with Python. And also make everyone attending aware of the basic things they can set up, to create there own coding environment and get started with programming in Python.

## Agenda
13h00 Welcome
13h10 Introduction to < a Python intro topic > (i.e. Python3, pip, virtualenv, OOP, etc.)
13h30 Q&A - Hands-on problem solving
14h30 See you next time! \o/


## Mentoring
The event will be lead by one or more mentors introducing a topic and guiding through a self-learning study time after a small break.
Mentors are more than welcome to get in touch and give a ~15min introduction into a basic topic or answer questions during the Meetups.
